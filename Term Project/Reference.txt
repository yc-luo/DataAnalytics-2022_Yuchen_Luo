2 model
1: linear regression to investigate the relationship between model Year and MSRP, model year and electric range (using heating map maybe) 根据independence 确定dependence 确定一个函数
Model Year and price
Model Year and Electric range (will make 2 subsets, Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV))
1.1 cor-test 测试是否有关联 (NULL hypothesis), it should come first, (histogram, box-plot, distribution of data)

2: clustering (based on state, different region), K-means cluster

2.1 
Pure battery and hybrid, so 2 subsets will create. (Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV))
Range and price

2.2 
MSRP and different location(Zip code)
